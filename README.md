# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows the faulty code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description

The route handler for `/users/:id` directly accesses `req.params.id` without validating or handling the case where `id` is invalid (e.g., not a number, not found). This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as application crashes or inconsistent responses. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding proper error handling.  This includes:

1. **Input Validation:** Check if `req.params.id` is a valid number and possibly if it exists in a database.
2. **Error Handling:** If the ID is invalid, return an appropriate HTTP error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found) with an informative message.

This helps prevent unexpected errors and improves the overall robustness of the application.
